El criterio en el que me baso es ver el valor maximo de ambas columnas, el cual si vemos hasta el 75% de la muestra el precio llega hasta $1395 y luego el maximo se encuentra alojado en un numero con nueve ceros luego de la coma, lo cual no tiene logica a pagar por un alquiler a menos que la persona que lo busque sea millonario. Por el lado de los pies cuadrados podemos ver que el 75% de la muestra llega hasta 1150 pies, donde luego nuevamente el maximo se aloja en un numero con 6 ceros luego de la coma, provocando otra ves problemas para el analisis posterior. Por ende tomo los siguientes recaudos, atado a posteriores modificaciones de ser necesario, para poder empezar con los graficos.Tambien tenemos algunas preguntas como por ejemplo, quien alquilaria una casa con 75 baños, 35 baños o 25 baños. Suponiendo que la persona sea adinerada y se pudiera dar el lujo de alquilar alguna de las casas disponibles, el tener mas de 7 baños ya seria una casa totalmente excesiva para que viva cualquier familia. Por ende vamos a tener que modificar algunas cosas. Lo mismo sucede cuando hablamos de las camas, vemos que hay registros con mas de 1000 camas disponibles, una locura, a menos que se alquile un hotel
